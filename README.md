# Paper_Note
This rep is to record the papers I read recently, mainly focusing on medical image analysis (image registration, image segmentation, mesh reconstruction and disease diagnosis).

## Image Registration

### [Coordinate translator for learning deformable medical image registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03626)[International Workshop on Multiscale Multimodal Medical Imaging]
* **Note**： multi-layer registration, incorporate coordinate information

### [DeepStrain: a deep learning workflow for the automated characterization of cardiac mechanics]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03626](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.730316/full)[Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine]
* **Note**： deep learning networks for segmentation and registration, [code](https://github.com/moralesq/DeepStrain) available for computing myocardial strain
